# Problem Statement 2

In this, we have two scripts. One script will monitor the system and other will check the uptime.

To run the script, first set up a virtual environment:
```bash
❯ python -m venv venv
❯ . venv/bin/activate
❯ pip install -r requirements.txt
❯ python SystemMonitor.py -h
❯ python UptimeChecker.py -h
```
